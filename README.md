# Erudit Knowledge Map

The collaboration maps project is a visualization framework that uses metadata from the Erudit corpus to show the collaborative worldwide academic networks that make up the document corpora. Users can filter based on multiple factors including author, date, academic institution, and journal. Several levels of granularity allows users the ability to investigate how and when the corpus was created. Used in concert with the rest of the corpus analysis suite, the collaboration maps give a full view of academic partnerships and their geography.
