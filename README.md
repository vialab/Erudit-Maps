# Erudit Knowledge Map

The Érudit Knowledge Map aims at mapping the knowledge transfer that occurs in the Érudit corpus, such as co-authorship networks in specific journals, or by institution, date, author or paper title.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Please ensure that you have [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [GulpJS](https://gulpjs.com/) (optional) must be installed on your computer in order to run this application.

### Installing

Packages are bundled in `package.json`.

`npm install`

### Running the Node JS Server

After successfully installing you should be able to run the NodeJS server with the following command:

```
npm start
```

### Debugging

Several GulpJS functions have been pre-made in order to optimize the workflow. 

Here is a list of available tasks:

* `gulp vendor` - Copy third-party libraries from node_modules to client folder
* `gulp js` - Concatenate and minify javascript files
* `gulp css` - Compile SASS, concatenate and minify CSS
* `gulp dev` - Run `js`, `css` task and sync files to browser to automatically detect saved changes
* `gulp` - Run `vendor`, `js`, and `css` tasks

## Deployment

Deployment is made simple due to the use of Docker. Run the shell script using the command provided below, and ensure that the appropriate routing/proxies have been setup on your web server. 

NOTE: Modifications of used ports may be required.

```
./run.sh
```
